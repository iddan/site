I love drinking coffee but not any coffee. Fortunately, there are plenty of specialty coffee places I find their coffee really good. I'll try to keep this list up to date:

## Tel Aviv

### [Mae Café](https://www.maecafe.com/)

My favourite coffee roasters. You can visit either the roasting shop (technically it's part of Ramat Gan's Diamond Exchange but everyone counts it as part of the city) or one of their beautiful store. My personal favourite is their flagship store placed in the historical centre of Tel Aviv.

- The roasting shop: [15 Tuval St. Ramat Gan](https://goo.gl/maps/aFo44NCSLQqdFnZY8)
- The flagship store in the historical centre: [3 Montefiore St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/Na5HzzLJoDLYVH6y8)
- The store in the city centre: [98 Shlomo Ibn Gabirol St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/CTGA8tQSpbH8H6658)

### [WayCup Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/WayCupCoffeeTlv/)

A strong competition for Mae, WayCup is also roasting their coffee inside the city in an open store. Though, their main store is even more delightful to sit: for the lovely people that sit there and converse with each other. From bohemians, to techies. Babysitters to elders. All enjoying excellent coffee and (mostly) sunny days.

- The main store: [23 Yohanan HaSandlar St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/7k9AjEaMLd5kJ2acA)
- The roasting shop (near the historical centre): [17 Mikve Israel St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/zJoL12gAE8L5XRFt6)

### [Mela](https://www.facebook.com/people/Mela/100063507433490/)

Self described as: fresh local vegetarian deli with great coffee. Couldn't describe it better. Equipped with excellent coffee from [Ruth Coffee](https://www.ruthcoffee.co.il/), fresh food and unbelievable pastries (various vegan and gluten free options as well) Mela is THE place to go for coffee if you'd like to take a sandwich / a pastry next to it.

- Bazel square store (the old north): [20 Ashtori HaFarhi St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/r8HiU8w2UnybZRnn8)
- Mikve Israel store (near the historical centre): [23 Mikve Israel St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/oHR67RESLZ3pkDcv6)

### [Timothy](https://www.facebook.com/timothycafetlv/)

Another great coffee roasters. Timothy have stated with a small store just on the brink of the Yarkun river. Later, they expanded the store to also include a dedicated quiet office space and opened another branch in the Levinski market downtown.

- The main store: [187 Shlomo Ibn Gabirol St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/akYhk3iTeuoC53B1A)
- The Levinksi market store: [9 Zevulun St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/1zezrxNtpgKgyBRf6)

### [Nahat Coffee](https://www.nahatcoffee.com/)

Nahat Coffee is a micro-roastery ran by two coffee experts. In addition to their supreme coffee, I love their graphic design and story-telling about coffee.

- The main store: [1 Dizengoff Square, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/g72SCY81YTunLNYdA)
- The Herzliya store: [168 Wingate St, Herzliya](https://goo.gl/maps/6uXiykoxzjGC67aZ6)

### [Cafetish](https://www.instagram.com/cafetish.coffee)

Hidden inside the Montefiore neighborhood (not to be confused with Montefiore street), Caffetish is an excellent coffee micro-roastery that serves the locales, techies working nearby it (recently the neighborhood got connected with the tech park that resides on the other end of the Ayalon river). The coffee place is quiet, minimalist, and down to earth. A well kept secret in plain sight.

- Store: [21 Sderot Yehudit St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/GGQmXUGzfjVyjqfY8)

### [Edmund Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/Edmundcoffee/)

Edmund is the poster hipster coffee of Tel Aviv. Ran by 4 incredible men, who I got to befriend during the year I lived above it Edmund is a place that will make you feel at home and chic at the same time. Other than excellent coffee that they source from Nahat, they have Thema's matcha (a business I got to hear dreams about from the owner before she even started it, but nonetheless excellent matcha) and delicious pastries and food!

- The main store: [33 Yehuda Halevi St, Tel Aviv](https://goo.gl/maps/B38WHN9FXTj5v92i9)
- The Bavli store (more residential and for parents): [Toledano St 6, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/zEQztDJrZokC6JZV8)

### [Origem](https://www.origem.co.il/)

Origem (portuguese for origin) is a coffee place stated by a Brazilian whose daughter moved to Israel and they moved with her. Though they don't have many vegan options for sides to the coffee I like to occasionally go there for a good Brazilian coffee. When I went to Lisbon in 2022 the Brazilian owned coffee places there reminded me of this intimate coffee place in the old north.

- Store: [203 Dizengoff St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/YrEBF1QGzLp9nzB16)
