I love drinking coffee but not any coffee. Fortunately, there are plenty of specialty coffee places I find their coffee really good. I'll try to keep this list up to date:

## Tel Aviv

### [Mae Café](https://www.maecafe.com/)

My favourite coffee roasters. You can visit either the roasting shop (technically it's part of Ramat Gan's Diamond Exchange but everyone counts it as part of the city) or one of their beautiful store. My personal favourite is their flagship store placed in the historical centre of Tel Aviv.

- The roasting shop: [15 Tuval St. Ramat Gan](https://goo.gl/maps/aFo44NCSLQqdFnZY8)
- The flagship store in the historical centre: [3 Montefiore St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/Na5HzzLJoDLYVH6y8)
- The store in the city centre: [98 Shlomo Ibn Gabirol St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/CTGA8tQSpbH8H6658)

### [WayCup Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/WayCupCoffeeTlv/)

A strong competition for Mae, WayCup is also roasting their coffee inside the city in an open store. Though, their main store is even more delightful to sit: for the lovely people that sit there and converse with each other. From bohemians, to techies. Babysitters to elders. All enjoying excellent coffee and (mostly) sunny days.

- The main store: [23 Yohanan HaSandlar St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/7k9AjEaMLd5kJ2acA)
- The roasting shop (near the historical centre): [17 Mikve Israel St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/zJoL12gAE8L5XRFt6)

### [Mela](https://www.facebook.com/people/Mela/100063507433490/)

Self described as: fresh local vegetarian deli with great coffee. Couldn't describe it better. Equipped with excellent coffee from [Ruth Coffee](https://www.ruthcoffee.co.il/), fresh food and unbelievable pastries (various vegan and gluten free options as well) Mela is THE place to go for coffee if you'd like to take a sandwich / a pastry next to it.

- Bazel square store (the old north): [20 Ashtori HaFarhi St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/r8HiU8w2UnybZRnn8)
- Mikve Israel store (near the historical centre): [23 Mikve Israel St, Tel Aviv-Yafo](https://goo.gl/maps/oHR67RESLZ3pkDcv6)
