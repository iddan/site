Over the past few years I've visited Rome a few times. This is a short list of recommendations for first that visit the eternal city.
For coffee recommendations please see [Rome in my coffee list](/cafes#rome).

### Historical Sites

#### The Pantheon

https://maps.app.goo.gl/EzWVLNyLKkMkv6596

One of Rome’s best-preserved ancient buildings, the Pantheon is a former Roman temple known for its massive dome and central oculus that lets in a column of natural light. Its perfect proportions and engineering have inspired architects for centuries, and inside you'll find the tombs of notable figures, including the painter Raphael.

#### The Colosseum

https://maps.app.goo.gl/V8ssifcS83WVd2N59

Rome’s iconic amphitheater, the Colosseum hosted gladiatorial games, public spectacles, and political events for tens of thousands of spectators. Walking through it gives a vivid sense of ancient Roman entertainment culture and the massive engineering efforts behind this 1st-century structure.

#### Piazza Navona & Chiesa di Sant'Agnese in Agone

https://maps.app.goo.gl/uEFpKCtciJ9w6S4TA

Piazza Navona is one of Rome’s liveliest squares, built on the footprint of an ancient stadium and lined with cafés, fountains, and Baroque architecture. The highlight is Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers facing Borromini’s elegant Church of Sant’Agnese in Agone, a perfect example of Rome’s artistic rivalry and beauty.

#### The Forum & Capitoline Hill

https://maps.app.goo.gl/zCJUzotYbBrfGv6f6

The Roman Forum was the political, religious, and commercial heart of ancient Rome, filled with temples, basilicas, and public meeting spaces. Nearby Capitoline Hill offers panoramic views over the ruins and houses Michelangelo-designed piazzas and museums that showcase Rome’s most important ancient artifacts.

#### Temple of Adrian

https://maps.app.goo.gl/WTeFQ6Uu8qpCrH3Y9

Dedicated to Emperor Hadrian, this temple now forms part of a modern building, but its surviving Corinthian columns still tower over the street. It’s a striking example of how ancient Rome blends seamlessly with the contemporary city.

#### Chiesa di Sant'Ignazio di Loyola

https://maps.app.goo.gl/uLp9XEdYbYd8bWmv8

A Baroque masterpiece known for its mind-bending ceiling frescoes, this church creates the illusion of a soaring dome through astonishing trompe-l’œil painting. It’s one of Rome’s most impressive examples of artistic illusion and Jesuit architectural grandeur.

#### The Spanish Steps

https://maps.app.goo.gl/5YY85bXTrxXBXbB2A

A sweeping 18th-century staircase linking Piazza di Spagna with the Trinità dei Monti church, the Spanish Steps are a classic Roman meeting point. The area is surrounded by elegant streets, shops, and the famous Barcaccia Fountain by Bernini’s father.

#### Portico of Octavia

https://maps.app.goo.gl/SG63LM3Jnkpo8KqQ8

Located in the Jewish Ghetto, the Portico of Octavia is the impressive remains of a structure built by Augustus in honor of his sister. Its surviving columns and archways give a glimpse into the monumental architecture of Rome’s imperial period and the layers of history in this atmospheric neighborhood.

#### Fontana di Trevi

https://maps.app.goo.gl/oGDzXLnz5Vgk4C6N9

A cliché but must mention, the most iconic fountain in europe. Recommended to see at night.

#### Fontana delle Tartarughe

https://maps.app.goo.gl/1QLaWKBTj5Ktq9Gb9

Nice renaissance fountain in the heart of Rome.

#### Palatine Hill

https://maps.app.goo.gl/voWNYSbSoKyYg9zU8

One of the most important sites in ancient Rome, Palatine Hill is where emperors built their lavish palaces and where, according to legend, Romulus founded the city. Walking its ruins and gardens gives you sweeping views over the Forum and Circus Maximus, along with a sense of how Rome’s rulers lived at the height of imperial power.

### Villas & Parks

#### Villa Borghese

https://maps.app.goo.gl/ckvkZUvim2swYhjLA

Rome’s central green oasis, Villa Borghese is a vast landscaped park filled with museums, fountains, quiet paths, and lake views. It’s perfect for a relaxed walk, a bike ride, or a visit to the world-class Galleria Borghese, all just steps away from the city’s busiest streets.

#### Villa Ada

https://maps.app.goo.gl/hdkRefHdq3uj4zz18

One of Rome’s largest parks, Villa Ada offers a more natural, wooded atmosphere with long walking trails, open fields, and a calm, local vibe. It’s ideal if you want to escape the city noise and enjoy a peaceful stretch of greenery without the crowds.

#### Villa Sciarra

https://maps.app.goo.gl/B4wNKNuJssXMvN3H6

A kind of odd villa but charming non the less. Recommend [reading about it](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Sciarra_(Rome)>) when arriving.

#### Villa Medici

https://maps.app.goo.gl/EhBctMxnFbcJFjVH8

Overlooking the city near the Spanish Steps, Villa Medici is a Renaissance palace with beautiful gardens and sweeping views of Rome. Home to the French Academy, it offers guided tours that reveal elegant interiors, art studios, and one of the most serene green spaces in the historic center.

#### The Botanical Garden

https://maps.app.goo.gl/w1TxRhxanmXi1Tew8

Tucked behind Trastevere, Rome’s Botanical Garden is a peaceful haven with shaded paths, exotic plants, a bamboo forest, and a panoramic hillside view. It’s a quiet escape ideal for wandering, relaxing, and discovering a calmer, greener side of the city.

### Vatican

https://maps.app.goo.gl/kjnmJGmV8r63mf7VA

I've had tremendous fun in the Vatican museum (although being completely atheist and not a big fan of the Catholic church). Their art collection and gardens are just bigger and richer than anything I've seen. If you go make sure to free a whole day for it (or at the very least 4 hours).

### Cool Neighbourhoods & City Areas

#### Tiber Island

https://maps.app.goo.gl/XMnZQgKZwZBpN3ts8

The island in the river is a charming mini-neighborhood, hosting a full fledged hospital with a beautiful facade of palm trees. One of the best places to catch the Sunset in the city. Next to it is the Great Synagogue of Rome which is very nice to see from the outside.

#### Trastevere

https://maps.app.goo.gl/GosNE2x1wVio1XhF7

The more chic and young part of Rome, in recent years became a bit touristy but still it's charming streets, good restaurants and unique church make a good visit. Good to combine with Villa Sciarra. Also make sure to check out Tiramisú Merisù.

#### Prati

https://maps.app.goo.gl/wemcjAi35LusAbkz6

The neighborhood of my choice for staying in Rome, the neighborhood is out of the hustle and bustle of the centre but still in a walking distance, cleaner than most other neighbourhoods of Rome and consists of some of its finest restaurants and shops (like [La Soffitta Renovatio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p35XEHWXWj3SgUxF6) and [Enoteca Costantini](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PtYHspTKZFbCdHcB8))

#### Monti

https://maps.app.goo.gl/jzQV4KVbT7eUYhMa8

Cool neighborhood with pretty streets, cool shops and great restaurants (like [Urbana 47](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fz9a6AJfT9ZpBENK7) and [Grezzo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3npjW5osxm4nJEe27))

### Food & Cafe

#### La Soffitta Renovatio

https://maps.app.goo.gl/8omVJ4mP8YXrcDvK7

My favourite restaurant in Rome - featuring Neapolitan pizzas, Roman pasta dishes, and italian cuisine classics paired with great service this is the best experience of proper Roman dinner.

#### Tiramisú Merisù

https://maps.app.goo.gl/jka8qePYeQp71Me47

One of the best tiramisus in the city made in front of you. Sometime there's a bit of a line outside, but don't worry - it moves fast.

#### Urbana 47

https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fz9a6AJfT9ZpBENK7

Hip bistro - much recommended for dinner

#### Grezzo

https://maps.app.goo.gl/3npjW5osxm4nJEe27

Raw chocolate and pastries. Had here some of the best vegan desserts I had so far.

#### Neve di Latte

https://maps.app.goo.gl/3uWjtMjxVcrGn4gG8
https://maps.app.goo.gl/7CqqeNf8ULPsVHcF6
https://maps.app.goo.gl/VuCjANDYmntmMaaM8

A really good ice cream place.

#### Gelateria La Romana

https://maps.app.goo.gl/J9WZv2FZpCzZz2eU8

A really good ice cream place. Expanded to many european capitals (but recommended non the less).

#### Pizza Time

https://maps.app.goo.gl/G5YZhnuW9VAECJ549

Cool pizza take away place with a charming garden next to it ([Giardino di Largo Cairoli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qSeJ6KAwp6TaSh7SA)).

### Outside of Rome

#### Tivoli

A charming small city outside of Rome with some of the most magnificat villas in the country (such as [Villa d'Este](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h6mNw3a5QCJGmY9b6) and [Villa Adriana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pKoWChrviVCzRkjT8)). My recommendation: dedicate one day per villa. It's okay to go to Tivoli for one day and see one of them at a time.
